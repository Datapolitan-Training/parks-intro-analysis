# Let's talk data.

# The Value of Data
???
+ Facilitator prompts participants to reflect on the value of data in their work
+ Helpful to ask "how" when presented with reasons like "it tells us what happened" in order to get them thinking about the more intrinsic value of data
+ Also prompt to think about how they would manage something without data (experience, anecdote, etc.), particularly some process, office, effort with lots of elements or moving parts

--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe what happened directly or indirectly
--

+ Ex: "are the parks worst 10-10:59am? Why or why not?"

> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

## -Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*
???
+ Facilitator has participant read the quote and invites the class to reflect
+ Some will take this as talking about manipulation of data. It's more about the manipulation of context. The numbers aren't wrong, but are misused or not applied in the right context

# Group Exercise - [NYC Vision Zero](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/visionzero/index.page)
???
## Task: Students practice developing key questions around an analytical task unrelated to NYC Parks to encourage broad participation and engagement
## Outcome: Students gain experience formulating and defining an analytical question to be explored in data not directly connected to the work they generally perform
## Format: Individual, small group, large group facilitated ideation, co-creation, and discussion
## Start by asking participants: what do you know about vision zero?
## Being reading slides by setting the scene: As the best analysts in NYC, we've all been recruited by the mayor into the vision zero task force.

# Data Driven Culture
> “Do you have data to back that up?” should be a question that no one is afraid to ask (and everyone is prepared to answer)

## - Julie Arsenault

[Source](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/how-to-create-a-data-driven-culture/)

+ Facilitator offers the quote and invites reflection
+ Optionally, facilitator can introduce the HiPPO idea (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) and the value of being anti-HiPPO to be data-driven, as well as the difficulty of doing that in government
---

name:final
# Final Thoughts
--

+ Don't try to boil the ocean
--

+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
--

+ Good analysis is about telling a true and compelling story
--

+ Be good to your data and it will be good to you
--

+ Try to focus on outcomes, not just outputs

=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
```
+ Example

# VLOOKUP
+ We're going to write a formula to bring in the Sites information to the Features table
+ Insert a column next to `inspection_id`
+ This will be our key lookup value
+ Call the column "district"
+ Use this formula

```
=VLOOKUP(A2,AMPSInsExtract_Jun2016_Sites_20170613.csv!$A$1:$F$4841,2,FALSE)
```
+ Do the same for "propid" and extract the borough with a formula
+ Add "inspection_date" if that looks interesting to you
